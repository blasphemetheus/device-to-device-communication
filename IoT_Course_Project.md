Choosing the Hands On Option:

**Hands-on Option (HO)**

The goal of this project is to give you **practical experience** in designing, implementing, and testing an IoT or IoT security system. You will choose a problem or challenge, design a solution, and build a working prototype using available hardware/software tools.

**Project Instructions**

1. Topic Selection

   * Choose a specific **IoT system** or **IoT security system** to investigate.

   * You are encouraged to pick a problem relevant to your **day-to-day life or environment**. Examples from past projects include:

     * Monitoring if a dog has left the yard.

     * Detecting when mail is delivered in a mailbox located far from the home.

     * Monitoring soil moisture to automate plant watering.

   * Submit your topic by the **first deadline** (see Rubric/Timeline).

   * The instructor will approve the topic or suggest adjustments.

2. System Design & Development

   * Break down your project into components (e.g., sensing, communication, data processing, alerting, security features).

   * Design the architecture of your system, identifying the hardware/software you plan to use.

   * If needed, you may borrow **Raspberry Pi devices** from the department to support your implementation.

   * Begin building and testing your prototype system.

3. Midterm Progress Report

   * By the **midterm deadline**, submit a progress report and demonstrate your current prototype status.

   * The instructor will provide feedback, suggest modifications, and offer technical guidance or hacks to improve the system.

4. Final Submission

   * Complete your IoT/IoT security system prototype.

   * Submit:

     * A **written project report** describing the problem, system design, implementation, evaluation, and lessons learned.

     * A **demonstration video** (5–8 minutes) showing your system in action.

   * Submit all deliverables by the **final deadline**.

—---------------------------------  
The Course Project will be a Hands On Project. The idea for the project is implementing device-to-device communication using WiFi adhoc, Bluetooth. There is room to look into other methods of D2D communication using Zigbee or LoRa, but this would require connecting dongles that act as transceivers given the current plan to use Raspberry Pi 3s. LoRa, a Low-Power Wide Area Network technology, should be looked into more by me before proceeding to buy any sort of transceiver dongle.
